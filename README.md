### I am currently attending a Data Analytics bootcamp at University of California, Irvine where I am gaining hands-on experience using tools like Python, working with databases including Postgres, and finding meaningful insights from data. I am looking forward to where this will lead as I enjoy using data analytics tools and resources to tell interesting stories about data.
